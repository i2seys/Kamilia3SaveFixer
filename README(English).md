# Kamilia3SaveFixer

This program solves the **"wrong savefile"** error that occurs when running ***I Wanna kill the Kamilia 3 or its EZ version.***

Before you start, it is highly recommended to make a backup of your important saves, even though the program only deletes files with empty saves.

If you follow the instructions exactly, you will end up with working saves in the "Data" folder and a backup folder containing the same saves, but with the "wrong files" error.

This program was inspired by this video: *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enJAE96bab4&t=158s*

If you find a bug, you can post it here: *https://github.com/i2seys/Kamilia3SaveFixer/issues*

If something goes wrong, you can find the **k3_fixer_log.txt** file in the program folder. It contains data about the latest program errors.

Special thanks to my friend Misha for help in developing the program.
