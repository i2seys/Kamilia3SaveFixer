# Kamilia3SaveFixer

This program solves the **"wrong savefile"** error that occurs when starting ***I Wanna kill the Kamilia 3 or its EZ version*** after transferring save files from another device.

**Before you start, it is highly recommended to make a backup of your important K3 saves, even though the program only deletes files with empty saves.**

You are solely responsible for your lost saves. **One more time - copy your saves.**

If you follow the instructions exactly, you will end up with working saves in the "Data" folder and a backup folder containing the same saves, but with the "wrong files" error.

This program was inspired by this video: *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enJAE96bab4&*

If you find a bug, you can post it here: *https://github.com/i2seys/Kamilia3SaveFixer/issues*

If something goes wrong, you can find the **k3_fixer_log.txt** file in the program folder. It contains data about the latest program errors.

Special thanks to my friend Misha for help in developing the program.
